# North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NPLCC) 
# Prioritization Tool

[Ecotrust](http://ecotrust.org) and the [NPLCC](http://www.fws.gov/pacific/Climatechange/nplcc/) have partnered 
to develop a conservation decision support system for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and 
California's coastal temperate rainforst.
This system will enable stakeholder to engage in strategic planning and program delivery of 
conservation and restoration priorities for the North Pacific Region.

The software will be built on the Madrona platform which, in turn, makes use of GeoDjango, PostGIS and the Google Earth API.
