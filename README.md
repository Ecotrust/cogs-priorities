# COGS Prioritization Tool

[Ecotrust](http://ecotrust.org), in partnership with USFWS, has built a prioritization tool 
to support national-scale refuge planning through the *COGS* process.

The current version uses vector shapes but a branch is on the way to convert the process to raster map tiles.

This would likely mean eliminating the ability to select sub-geographies but would allow us to scale up to a far greater number of planning units.
